 * MISSING VALUES

 	1] Ways to remove them
		1] How to completly remove the values 
		2] SimpleImputer class
		3] KNN imputer 
		4] Iterative imputer
		5] Missin
		
	2] Impute them (SimpleImputer)
		1] Univariate
			a) Numerical
				-> mean/median
				-> random value 
				-> end of distrubution value
			b) Categorical
				-> mode
				-> "missing"

		2] Multivariate
			       -> KNN imputer 
			       -> Iterative imputer (MICE)

  1] How to completely remove them 
	
	-> CCA (Complete case analysis)
		Analysing only those observations(row) which there is information in aall variables in the dataset

	Assumptions(MCAR)
		-> Data should be randomly missing not like the first 50 missing or the last 50 missing
	
	Advantages:
		1} Easy to Implement no data manipulation required
		2} if data is MCAR the distrubution is preserved

	Disadvantages:
		1} It can exclude large chunk of data
		2} Excluded observations could be informative
		3} wWhile using model in prduction the model will not know how to handle missing values


	When to use CCA
		1] When data is MCAR
		2] Generally we dont apply CCA if there is more than 5% data missing

 
   2] SimpleImputer (Numerical)
   	a) Univariate -> using the values of that particular row only to fill the missing data
	b) Bivariate -> using the values of the other rows to fill the missing data 


	A] Univariate

	1] Mean/Median imputation
		if distrubution is normal use mean if distrubution is skewed use median

		Benifits:
		-> Simple 
		-> Not reliable for 5% + missing data 

		Disadvantages
		-> changes the shape of the distrubution
		-> Outliers come 
		-> covariance/corelation changes

		When to use
		-> MCAR
		-> data missing less than 5%

	2] Arbitary value imputation 
		mostly done for Categorical data but can be used for Numerical
		using that value which is not present in the column for numerical 
		used when data is not missin at random
		Benifits:
		-> Simple

		Disadvantages:
		-> changes the shape of the distrubution
		-> Outliers come 
		-> covariance/corelation changes

		When to use
		-> MCAR
		-> data missing less than 5%

	* Handling missing categirical data
	1] Replace with most frequent values(MODE)
		a) MCAR
		b) The mode should be very much more freq than others
		-> easy to implement
		-> changes the distribution



	2] replace missin gdata with "missing"
