 1] ESTIMATORS
 	
	# Object that learns from data
	# It has a fit method
	eg: linear_regression.fit , Kmean.fit, decisiontree.fit, standard Scalar

	# There are two types
	a) Predictor
		learns from data and then predicts the output

	b) Transformer
		learns from data and applies transfromation on the new data and make it simpler for ml Algorithms
		eg: ohe,oe,mms,ss,pca,
